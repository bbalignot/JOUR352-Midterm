<!-- STORY -->
                    <p>It’s over. For the last half-decade, we’ve enjoyed a golden age in
                        entertainment. The rise of the streaming service has brought more TV and
                        film into our homes than ever before. It’s been a joy — and sometimes a
                        chore — to keep up with every new offering Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus,
                        and the rest put before us. But over the last few months, we’ve seen a
                        reorientation of how many of these services do business, and it’s clear
                        that this glut of content we’ve enjoyed, for the mere cost of a monthly
                        subscription, is about to end. Some of us are going to keenly feel the
                        pain of that more than others.</p>

                    <p>Before streaming changed the landscape of Hollywood, it was a very
                        different place. It could take writers years to become showrunners, and
                        the number of plum roles for a new star was few and far between. There was
                        a lot of reality TV — particularly on cable — but scripted television was
                        limited to just a handful of channels. The owners of those channels were
                        in a brutal competition for your eyeballs, crafting prestige show after
                        prestige show to arrest our attention. From 1999, with the premiere of <em>The
                        Sopranos</em>, to somewhere in the mid-2010s, there was a Golden Age of TV.</p>

                        <p class="caption"><strong>Graph depicting the number of original TV shows broken up by service type.</strong></p>
                        <p class="photocredit"><em>Graph courtesy of Statista</em></p>
                        <br>

                    <p>Then the streaming wars came, and let’s be real: it was a blast. It was
                        another golden age. Netflix started pouring money into Hollywood in an
                        effort to build a cache of big hits so it could compete with the likes of
                        Disney and Warner Brothers and MGM who owned most of the biggest
                        franchises. But while Netflix has struggled to build big franchises
                        outside of <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>Bridgerton</em>, and <em>The Witcher</em> (the latter two
                        are based on hugely popular book series), it was churning out a lot of
                        content, effectively throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks.</p>

                    <p>And it felt like everyone else followed suit. The rival streamers all
                        clearly had their own content strategies based around stuff like <em>Game of
                        Thrones, Star Wars</em>, and whatever cowboy stuff Taylor Sheridan wants to get
                        up to, but they were also willing to experiment in a way that was uncommon
                        before the streaming wars.</p>

                    <blockquote class="pullquote">"In the streaming world, there’s infinite shelf space, which theoretically means it doesn’t matter how many people watch a thing already commissioned and produced as long as someone watches it."</blockquote>

                    <p>That experimentation was a particular boon for marginalized communities.
                        Because when the distribution channels for TV and film were limited to a
                        number of timeslots on cable and in the theaters, Hollywood was cautious —
                        only putting money into films and TV that would appeal to the widest
                        audience, which meant film and TV was very male-oriented, very white, and
                        very, very straight.</p>

                    <p>The streaming wars opened up more avenues of distribution, which meant
                        more action shows with women as the leads, comedies that didn’t need a
                        white dude or a big-time comedian to anchor them, and dramas with a happy
                        ending and a title character that was queer. We often like to measure
                        diversity in entertainment by “firsts,” and in the last few years, we’ve
                        racked up more firsts than in a dozen preceding years.</p>

                    <p>But these unprecedented times, where we had so much scripted content
                        available that Hollywood faced a showrunner shortage, are coming to a
                        close. While the streaming wars haven’t ended, there’s definitely a lull
                        in the fight, and the streamers are all adjusting their tactics. They
                        poured a lot of money into content in the hopes of securing subscribers,
                        but now there’s increased competition, and it’s no longer feasible to just
                        shovel cool shows into our mouths with little programming strategy beyond
                        “seems neat.”</p>

                    <p>Last month, Netflix’s co-CEO Reed Hastings appeared at The New York Times’
                        annual DealBook Summit to talk about the platform and streaming in
                        general. He was candid about the need for Netflix to make money and made
                        it clear that he’d take the successes where he would get them regardless
                        of the cultural costs, which means he’ll happily commission Dave Chappelle
                        specials “again and again” even if they’re so transphobic they inspire
                        protests, but smaller, more emphatically queer shows like <em>Warrior Nun</em> and
                        <em>The Babysitter’s Club</em> get canceled — despite seeming to do well based on
                        the few metrics Netflix makes public.</p>

                    <p>HBO Max is a more clear-cut, if devastating, example of the shifting
                        strategies of the streaming wars. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav
                        has been extraordinarily clear that he’ll sacrifice plenty of shows and
                        movies if it means he can save a buck. The practically finished <em>Batgirl</em>
                        was shelved for tax savings (unshelving it would now be costly for the
                        same reason), and over the summer and fall, dozens more films and TV shows
                        were unceremoniously yanked from the service to allegedly avoid paying
                        residuals to the people who worked on them.</p>

                    <img class="graph" src="images/Bar Graph - Presentation.png" alt="Streaming Cost Graphic">
                    <p class="caption"><strong>Graph depicting the cost of streaming services as of 2023.</strong></p>
                    <br>

                    <p>This week, more shows got a similar “anything to save a buck” ax.
                        <em>Westworld</em>, which was canceled after four seasons, was pulled from HBO Max
                        alongside <em>The Nevers</em> — the Joss Whedon-helmed show that started terribly
                        and turned fascinating before it went on hiatus in 2021. The second half
                        of its first season is supposedly complete, but neither half will be
                        airing on HBO Max. Nor will the second season of Minx, a surprisingly fun
                        period show about making a dirty magazine for women. The show has already
                        been renewed by HBO Max, and Variety claims the service may be shopping it
                        around to other distributors.</p>

                    <p>TV shows suddenly being canceled with entire episodes shelved was
                        relatively common pre-streaming. There were limited slots to air stuff on
                        TV, and TV channels would rather air an old rerun than the final episode
                        of a little-watched show if it meant it could sell pricier ads against
                        that rerun.</p>

                    <p>In the streaming world, there’s infinite shelf space, which theoretically
                        means it doesn’t matter how many people watch a thing already commissioned
                        and produced as long as someone watches it. This is why a pre-Zaslav HBO
                        Max had no problem showcasing abruptly ended shows like Swamp Thing and
                        that Flash series from the ’90s.</p>

                    <p>But you still have to pay creators residuals, and Zaslav is going to avoid
                        doing that if he thinks the audience on a specific show is too small
                        compared to the money he has to pay to keep that content on his service.
                        And the price of keeping those shows in perpetuity on a streaming service
                        is probably going to get more expensive soon, too. In 2023, the Writers
                        Guild of America, the Directors Guild of America, and the Screen Actors
                        Guild will all negotiate new contracts with the Alliance of Motion Picture
                        and Television Producers, and streaming residuals are going to be a major
                        point of discussion.</p>

                    <p>And to keep up with the rising costs of creating and maintaining content
                        on these services (and, to be clear, I am all for paying creators
                        appropriately for their content), streamers won’t just be looking to
                        secure your subscriptions — they’re gonna want to sell your viewership
                        against ads, which now every major streamer offers.</p>

                    <p>That means the next phase of this streaming war won’t be about securing
                        your long-term subscription with really cool shows that cater to smaller
                        audiences. It will be about reaching as wide an audience as possible to
                        secure eyeballs for ads. And that means this renaissance that’s appealed
                        to smaller segments of the population is going to come to an end, and
                        what’s left is just going to get more expensive.</p>
